The `add` command inserts new items in reverse order, the `del` command removes specified items, and the `disp` command displays the current list. The `sort` command organizes the items based on various criteria such as type, name, and ID, with support for reverse sorting. The project requires implementing these functionalities with proper error handling and efficient sorting algorithms.

The program reads maze descriptions from standard input, which include rooms, their coordinates, and tunnels connecting them. The goal is to find the shortest paths for robots to move from the entrance to the exit while avoiding congestion and optimizing the number of robots that can pass through in each lap. The program needs to output the number of robots, the maze configuration, and a detailed series of moves for each lap. This involves implementing pathfinding algorithms and handling maze representation efficiently. Additionally, a bonus option includes creating a labyrinth viewer for visualization.",projectLink:"",tags:[c.C],pictures:[]}]}GetProjects(){return this.project}GetProjectById(n){let i=this.project.find(p=>p.id===n);if(i===void 0)throw new TypeError("There is no project that matches the id: "+n);return i}};e.\u0275fac=function(i){return new(i||e)},e.\u0275prov=I({token:e,factory:e.\u0275fac,providedIn:"root"});let t=e;return t})();var E=(()=>{let e=class e{constructor(n,i){this.titleService=n,this.projectService=i,this.featuredProject={},this.titleService.setTitle("Jean-marc Naounou - Home")}ngOnInit(){this.featuredProject=this.projectService.GetProjectById(0)}};e.\u0275fac=function(i){return new(i||e)(l(f),l(C))},e.\u0275cmp=m({type:e,selectors:[["app-home"]],decls:10,vars:0,consts:[[1,"container"],[1,"row"],[1,"col-lg","shadow","border","m-1"],[1,"text-center"]],template:function(i,p){i&1&&(o(0,"div",0)(1,"div",1)(2,"div",2)(3,"div",3)(4,"h2"),a(5,"About Me"),r(),o(6,"p"),a(7,"As a passionate software engineering student at EPITECH, I am driven by a deep enthusiasm for computer science and software development.
